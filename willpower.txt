I think of two versions of me in the future, one of which is an ordinary man who doesn't look much different than me. The other is a badass personality tough and skilled who only looks like me. I tell myself what I do today determines which of these personalities I will become. Today is the day that the tough guy is born. Today is were it all began. This doesn't give me motivation. It gives me the willpower to take hardships, as this is my journey to my vision of future. A man my partner would be proud, who my children will look up to, who the society looks upto. In future I will look back to this very day and to say this weak kid writing these sentences, 'thanks for all the hardships, we are where we are destined to be'.
